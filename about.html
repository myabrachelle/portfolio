    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about text-block">
        <a name="about"></a>
        My name is Mya Gibson and I am a junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual 
          degree in Earth & Environmental Science and Information Science, with a focus on environmental 
          consulting. I am really passionate about balancing the needs of our community with the rising use of 
          technology in our modern world. However, we are living in a world that is rapidly changing so solutions 
          need to be made to address future problems. This intersection, is something that I specialize in from 
          my previous experience in recognizing and addressing community needs through community-based companies, 
          as well as, having the foundational knowledge in the Earth Science and what is currently occurring in our 
          world today. I hope to work in an environment where I can bring both focuses to the table and cultivate an 
          environment that supports the needs of both concepts.

            have done throughout my educational and professional career!
