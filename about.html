                    My name is Mya Gibson and I am a junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual 
                    degree in Earth & Environmental Science and Information Science, with a focus on environmental 
                    consulting and UX Design.

                    I am really passionate about balancing the needs of our community with the rising use of 
                    technology in our modern world. However, we are living in a world that is rapidly changing so solutions 
                    need to be made to address future problems. This intersection, is something that I specialize in from 
                    my previous experience in recognizing and addressing community needs through community-based companies, 
                    as well as, having the foundational knowledge in the Earth Science and what is currently occurring in our 
                    world today.

                    I hope to work in an environment where I can bring both focuses to the table and cultivate an 
                    environment that supports the needs of both concepts. I truly had the opportunity to explore a role 
                    that balances both technology and people 
                    after working as a IT consultant for a small, non-profit company called ABC Solutions. 
                    It was there that I learned beneficial trade skills such as learning more about how to communicate 
                    with different schools and businesses within the Detroit area.

                             This job opened my eyes to the possibilities 
                            and promises that information science will bring to the growing modern world as technology plays an important 
                            role in increasing traffic and awareness for smaller groups in society. Through the use of technology, 
                            I was able to help set up the process in increasing productivity on the companyâ€™s website to allow easier 
                            access for newer users while allowing recurring customers to see the success rate from previous clientele. 
                            Seeing how crucial it was to improve ease of use for all users in order of creating new business was both 
                            exciting and eye-opening as I saw the direct result of engagement with working in a career-setting that 
                            depends on both technology and people.
