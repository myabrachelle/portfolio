            <p> Hi, my name is Mya Gibson and I am a senior at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I am currently studing 
                Earth & Environmental Science and Information Science with a focus in UX design and environmental strategy.
                <br>
                <br>
                My passion in UX Design and Geology began during my freshman year when I was taking EECS 183. In this course, 
                I enjoyed creating a digital game that challenged users to quickly escape mazes. My team even gained recognition by 
                Stryker as the showcase winner for the semester. Although this experience was enjoyable and rewarding, I felt like the 
                user perspective was missing in our design, which made the project feel incomplete. Simultaneously, while taking Earth classes, 
                I researched multiple environmental case studies and noticed that the user perspective was again missing. This was something that 
                stuck with me. If the people from those impacted communities were taken into consideration when deciding solutions, then the corrective 
                actions would have been more permanent. This is why I believe that user-centered research is crucial in establishing long-term solutions.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the 2021-22 academic year, I plan on pursuing a Master’s Degree in Human-Computer Interaction in an accelerated program 
                offered within the University of Michigan’s School of Information. By pursuing a Master’s Degree, I plan to build expertise 
                incorporating user-centered designs in complex societal issues such as climate change and energy sourcing. My short term goal is to 
                identify UX methods that efficiently gather and apply insights from diverse groups to improve products or services that impact local 
                communities. If you want to see some of my work, then please look at my portfolio page to learn more about 
                my educational and professional projects!
